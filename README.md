1. Executive Summary

The Feugo 15 project is an innovative initiative to design and build a buggy that serves as both a technical challenge and a platform to impress our college community. Powered by a 150cc Hero CBZ petrol engine, the buggy features an open chassis constructed from rectangular steel pipes with integrated suspension and designated measurement provisions. The system incorporates modern electronics—including an Arduino/ESP-based control system with optional LoRa/GSM communication—and a mobile-controlled interface, offering functions such as engine start/stop, key activation, and an emergency kill switch. In addition, F15 is designed to support workshops, technical talks, webinars, driving events, and competitive races.
